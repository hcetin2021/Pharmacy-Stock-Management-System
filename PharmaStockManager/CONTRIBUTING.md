# Contributing to PharmaStockManager

The initial setup and commit of this project was made to define the project architecture, dependencies, and initial configurations. Now that the project structure is complete, all new development will occur on separate branches.

Please make sure to follow the branching strategy:
- **Main Branch**: Reserved for stable releases.
- **Feature Branches**: All new features and changes should be developed on separate branches.

This project is now open for collaboration, and we encourage contributions from all team members.
